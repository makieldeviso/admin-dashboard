# Admin Dashboard

## About
An admin dashboard for a company named Trash Panda Co. portfolio project. Exemplify web layout design using CSS, emphasizing use of Flex and Grid display rules.

## Objective
Create an admin dashboard that can be perceived by the user as usable and properly arranged through the use of CSS Flex and Grid display rules in layout design.

This project is mainly to showcase styling. To practice different layout scenarios, the dashboard section buttons were scripted to change layout.

## Features
The Home section displays projects, announcements and team. Most of the contents were placeholders, pre made with JavaScript to remove repetitive content writing in HTML. Focusing in the layout, the projects are displayed in a grid, while the announcements and team are in flex display. Contents containers have scroll bars to accommodate overflow. The projects are the highlight for Home section.

Throughout the accessible sections of the dashboard, the main highlight changes respective to the section selected, while retaining the announcements and team contents.

Next, the Profile section changes the main highlight to the employee/ member profile. The profile details and the employee information are displayed in a grid, wherein the first column is occupied solely by the main identification and the second column has its rows occupied by other groups of information. This was executed using grid-template-areas rule to place assigned parts to its respective position in the grid.

Then, the Tasks section features tasks layout in a flex display through a column flex-direction. While individual task has its own grid display that arranges its contents and buttons.

Finally, the the Communities section is also presented in grid display and its contents have flex display.

To iterate, the focus of this project is to design a layout using flex and grid display. Most of the buttons has no functionality but will pop a dialog simulating a site maintenance error message.

This dashboard is also responsive, it will adjust layout to smaller screen devices. A hamburger menu button is added to the header bar, which when pressed slides-in the sidebar used for switching between sections. Meanwhile in the main display view, there are tab buttons to switch between the section highlight, announcements and team displays.
